⚛️ Interactive 3D Atom Simulator

This is a single-file, interactive web application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js that visualizes the Bohr model of an atom. Users can change the element and adjust the number of electrons to explore how atomic structure determines an element's identity and its charge state (ion formation).

✨ Features

3D Visualization: Renders a responsive, rotatable 3D model of the atom, including the nucleus and electron shells.

Element Selection: Quickly switch between the first five elements (Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron) to view their neutral atomic structure.

Customization via Sliders:

Protons (Z): Change the atomic number to simulate different elements (up to Argon, Z=18).

Electrons: Adjust the electron count to visualize ions (cations and anions) and track the atom's charge state.

Real-time Info: An overlay panel displays the element name, atomic number, electron count, and calculated charge.

Interactive Rotation: Drag or swipe the screen to rotate the atom in 3D space.

🚀 How to Use

Open the File: Since this is a self-contained HTML file (atom_simulator.html), simply open it directly in any modern web browser.

Select an Element: Use the quick-access buttons (H, He, Li, Be, B) to load the neutral structure of those elements.

Customize the Atom:

Use the Protons (Z) slider to select a specific element (from 1 to 18).

Use the Electrons slider to add or remove electrons and observe how the charge state changes (displayed in the top-left corner).

Interact: Click, drag, or swipe the 3D model to rotate it and view the orbiting electrons from different angles.
